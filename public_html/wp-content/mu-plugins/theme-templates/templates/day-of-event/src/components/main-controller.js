	// what's a good way to handle that?

// todo also unfinished comments on https://github.com/wceu/wordcamp-pwa-page/pull/11

// todo run php/css/js linters on everything after removing all the todos, refactoring, etc

// todo reduce bundle size, 10k is way too big for a small thing like this

// what happens if browser doesn't support service workers?
	// do they still get content template? they should, but they'll hits api every 60 seconds, so need to detect that and change limit to every 15 minutes in those cases
	// maybe usage not high enough to justify the time spent on that though

// add other wp-scripts to package.json scripts, like linting, etc
	// maybe create a central wordcamp.org build process for anything using wp-scripts?
	// avoid duplication and managing lots of little things that all do the same thing
	// need to convert blocks to wp-scripts first though
