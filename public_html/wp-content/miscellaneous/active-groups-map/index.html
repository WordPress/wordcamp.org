	### todo
		some meetups, like seattle and NYC are missing, maybe b/c the coordinates overlap too closely and google is filtering them out?
			maybe just coincidence and some meetup groups that don't have wordcamps are missing too?

	### process to build KML file:
		export wordcamps to csv from wordcamp.org script
 			probably don't need these though, since wordcamps have to have a meetup first
 			maybe some odd edge cases, though?
		export meetsup to csv from stats script
		import into My Maps
			maybe don't need this step. can import csv into Earth?
			if need to do this again, just write script like described below
		export to kml. it'll be missing coordinates
		import into google earth, it'll add coordinates
		export to kml
		find/replace <linearring> with <!-- <linearring> and same for closing tag
		upload to wordcamp.org or other public server w/ valid SSL (not local dev environment)
		update the URL below for the KmlLayer

	### potential process improvements if use this again in future
	 	could have a script that generates the exact KML we want, instead of bothering with My Maps and Earth
	 	don't need to combine them, can have multiple kmllayers, so just setup one file for each layer. it's fine to have one script for wordcamps and another for meetups
	 	actually, you have to have a meetup to have a camp, so for this purpose, we really only need meetups, the camps will just be dupes

	### misc
		potentially interesting to use this to see which areas don't have a meetup within driving distance, and focus some efforts there, to make sure everyone in the world has access to a meetup
