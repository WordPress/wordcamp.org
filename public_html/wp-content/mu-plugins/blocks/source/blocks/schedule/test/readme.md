### sample-sessions.xml

This file contains sample data that covers all of the use- and edge- cases from that Mark identified when developing the prototype for this block.

See https://codepen.io/mrwweb/pen/ZaONLW and https://codepen.io/mrwweb/pen/rgPOOd.

We may eventually want to change this to a JSON file and write unit tests against that, but that's currently very difficult to setup with wp-scripts. For now WXR is the easiest format to transfer this data between dev environments, and investing the time in comprehensive tests isn't worth it.

For more details on use/edge cases, see:
