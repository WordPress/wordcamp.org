 * test this across themes
 * test with child themes to make sure parent theme stylesheet is cached too
 * 		should theoretically pre-cache all stylesheets, but don't need to in practice b/c caching route takes care of?
 * 		can't hurt. maybe needed if regular cached assets are evicted to free up space, whereas precached ones wouldn't be?
 * test with themes replacing and extending the theme stylesheet (via jetpack/remote-css)
 * add date/time, location, schedule, etc -- https://github.com/wceu/wordcamp-pwa-page/issues/9
 * Should we add `{{{error_details_iframe}}}` ?
 * Should we add `wp_service_worker_error_details_template()` ?
 * Maybe list all of the pages that are available offline, ala https://chrisruppel.com/travel/
 * 		Maybe do that instead of the regular navigation menu?
 * include sidebar?
