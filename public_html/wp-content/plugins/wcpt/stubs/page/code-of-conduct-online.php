<h3>Statement about Socials or Supplemental Events (where applicable)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social and supplemental events are intended to provide networking and additional educational opportunities, as well as an opportunity to unwind after a full WordCamp. They should also be places where attendees can feel safe and secure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We want you to enjoy yourself at these events, and we want you to do so safely. If you experience a Code of Conduct violation, see a violation, are concerned about the well-being, safety or behavior of another attendee, or have a general question (we understand that violations are not always obvious!) contact us immediately by notifying a WordCamp organizer or emailing <a href="mailto:report@wordcamp.org">report@wordcamp.org</a>. For in-person events, if you need help or are unable to comfortably or safely remove yourself from a situation you do not want to be in, organizers will prioritize assisting you immediately and discretely. Some examples are: not feeling well; your transportation arrangements fall through; you are intoxicated, you are alone or with someone you do not trust, you are overwhelmed, you have experienced or witnessed a Code of Conduct violation. Please ask any nearby event volunteer or organizer to help you.</p>
